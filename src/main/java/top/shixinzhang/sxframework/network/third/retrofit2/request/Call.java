 * Retrofit 的请求信息，每次 Call 都有自己的请求信息和响应信息，可以被同步或者异步执行
 *
 * An invocation of a Retrofit method that sends a request to a webserver and returns a response.
 * Each call yields its own HTTP request and response pair. Use {@link #clone} to make multiple
 * calls with the same parameters to the same webserver; this may be used to implement polling or
 * to retry a failed call.
 * <p>
 * <p>Calls may be executed synchronously with {@link #execute}, or asynchronously with {@link
 * #enqueue}. In either case the call can be canceled at any time with {@link #cancel}. A call that
 * is busy writing its request or reading its response may receive a {@link IOException}; this is
 * working as designed.
 *
 * @param <T> Successful response body type.
